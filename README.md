# pizza-app
This application provides an UI for users to select from a catalog of pizzas. Once they select their pizza they can change the quantity, customize it by adding different toppings. After the users build their pizza they can either choose carry out or delivery from various locations listes. I have used paypal sandbox to test if the transactions are being processed or not. After successful transaction an email is sent to the users. The application also has an administrative module, to add pizza, toppings and location details.
